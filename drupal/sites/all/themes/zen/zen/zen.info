  ; "core" specifies the version of Drupal that this theme is compatible with.
  ; "engine" specifies that this is a theme that uses the phptemplate engine,
  ; Drupal's default theme engine. Its unlikely you will ever need to change

  ; This section adds CSS files to your theme. The media type is specified in
  ; the brackets. Typical CSS media types include "all", "screen", "print", and
  ; "handheld". See http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html#media-types for a full
  ; list of stylesheet media types in CSS 2.1.
  ;
  ; You can also override any of Zen's stylesheets or any module's stylesheets,
  ; an /extremely/ useful feature. See the excellent Drupal 6 Theme Guide at
  ; http://drupal.org/node/171209 for more details.

  ; The layout CSS files are added by Zen's template.php file (based on its
  ; theme settings,) so we don't need to add them here. But if we did, it would
  ; look like this:

  ;   stylesheets[all][] = layout-liquid.css

  ; Set the conditional stylesheets that are processed by IE.

  ; The regions defined in Zen's default page.tpl.php file.  The name in
  ; brackets is the name of the variable in the page.tpl.php file, (e.g.
  ; "[content_top]" in the .info file means there should be a $content_top
  ; variable in the page.tpl.php file.) The text after the equals sign is a
  ; descriptive text used on the admin/build/blocks page.

  ; Various page elements output by the theme can be toggled on and off. The
  ; "features" control which of these check boxes display on the
  ; admin/build/themes config page. This is useful for suppressing check boxes
  ; for elements not used by your sub-theme. To suppress a check box, omit the
  ; entry for it below. See the Drupal 6 Theme Guide for more info:
