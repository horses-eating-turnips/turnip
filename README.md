# Turnip

Turnip is OpenSourcery's Drupal starting kit. Using a Drush Make
workflow, only custom modules, features and themes are committed to
the repository, which allows for teams to quickly get up to speed and
collaborate on the important parts of the project at hand. It includes
a starting framework for using Behat for behavior driven
development. Each site is built as an installation profile.

## Dependencies
The theming framework of choice for Turnip is the [Aurora Framework](http://snugug.github.io/Aurora/). In order to use this stack, you'll need your environment set up properly with Compass, Sass, Ruby, and a number of Ruby gems. It is possible to instantiate an install profile with turnip without instantiating a theme (see `skiptheme` flag, below). The default is to spin up the theme with the install profile.

### Setup the Ruby Environment
First, you'll need the Ruby environment itself so you can install Ruby gems. For Ubuntu (inlcuding 14.04), the easiest way to do this is to use RVM.

#### For Ubuntu and similar *NIXes

First you'll need the ruby dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
```

Next, the RVM dependencies:

```bash
cd ~
sudo apt-get install libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake libtool bison libffi-dev
```

Setup RVM in your home directory.

```bash
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
echo "source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Install the ruby versions of choice. Note that Ubuntu ships with Ruby 1.9.1 and it may be a good idea to have it lying around, so we install that version plus the latest stable.

```bash
rvm install 1.9.1
rvm install 2.1.1
rvm use 2.1.1 --default
```

Check your available rubies:

```bash
rvm list
```

Check the current version:

```bash
ruby -v
```

For the purposes of developing with the White Horses of Helios stack, you want to be using the latest version.

#### For OSX

There are many tools available for managing ruby versions, of note is [JeweleryBox](https://jewelrybox.unfiniti.com/)

### Install Compass and Sass
If you are using modern web technologies, you probably already have this set up. If not, check out [Installing Compass and Sass Across All Platforms](http://snugug.com/musings/installing-sass-and-compass-across-all-platform). Or, simply:

```bash
gem install compass
```

### Install OpenSourcery's Aurora Compass Extension
Having your Ruby environment setup, you can simply

```bash
gem install compass-aurora-os
```

This Gem is under active development, so if you already have the extension just be sure it's updated:

```bash
gem update compass-aurora-os
gem clean compass-aurora-os
```

## Installation

1. Turnip is best installed using [Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush). Make sure you have a `drush` executable in your `$PATH` and then:

    ```bash
    drush dl turnip
    drush turnip-init
    ```

    Drush will prompt you to set up the repository and build the base install profile. It will also set up the `turnip` remote to upstream Turnip. If you haven't set up your Ruby environment as described above, when prompted, you will want to skip building the theme. However, no theme can cause problems, so it's best to get your environment set up before installing Turnip. If you don't build a theme now, you can do it later by calling `bin/init-theme` from within the project root directory.

1. Add all your newly updated files with `git add -A` and then commit them. Now is a good time to set up your own remote repository if you plan on using Git for version control (which you should!). (See Step 2 under Manual Setup [below](https://github.com/opensourcery/turnip/blob/7.x/README.md#manual-setup). 

1. Customize `my_profile/my_profile.make`.

1. Make a `files` directory in the `shared` directory.

1. Customize `settings.local.php` with your database parameters and any special configurations.

1. Run `bin/install` for local development.

1. To avoid having to redeclare your default origin each time you pull or push, run your first push as:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

1. If this site has a production url, you can manually add it to `bin/.config` on the line `PRODUCTIONURL="http://"`.

1. Custom modules or features should go in `my_project/modules/custom`
   or `my_project/modules/features`. Any contrib modules put into the .make files will be placed into the appropriate directories automatically.

1. Turnip assumes you will keep your sensitive database information in an uncommitted (gitignored) file called `settings.local.php`. Make any applicable changes to `settings.local.php.example` and save it as `settings.local.php`.

## Manual setup

1. Either copy all files into a new repository or clone this
   repository, keeping an upstream origin named `turnip`:

    ```bash
    git clone -o turnip git@github.com:opensourcery/turnip.git foo_project
    cd foo_project
    git checkout -b master
    ```

1. Initialize git (if files were copied), and add a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:foo/bar.git
   ```

   Make sure your remote points to a repository that is set up.


1. Run `bin/make-install-profile` to instantiate an installation profile and spin up the `Arcturus` subtheme:

   ```bash
   bin/make-install-profile my_profile my_theme "Short name" "Long name"
   ```

  This would instantite an install profile, with an `Arcturus`-flavored Aurora subtheme. However, adding the `skiptheme` flag would instatiate an install profile, and leave the theme directory empty with no theme generated:

  ```bash
  bin/make-install-profile my_profile my_theme "Short name" "Long name" skiptheme
  ```

  All changes can then quickly be added via `git add -A`.

1. Customize `my_profile/my_profile.make`.

1. Make a `files` directory in the `shared` directory.

1. Copy `settings.local.php.example` to `settings.local.php` and fill in the databse parameters.

1. Run `bin/install` for local development.

1. To avoid having to redeclare your default origin each time you pull or push, run your first push as:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```
1. If this site has a production url, you can manually add it to `bin/.config` on the line `PRODUCTIONURL="http://"`.

1. Custom modules or features should go in `my_project/modules/custom`
   or `my_project/modules/features`. Any contrib modules put into the .make files will be placed into the appropriate directories automatically.

1. Turnip assumes you will keep your sensitive database information in an uncommitted (gitignored) file called `settings.local.php`. Make any applicable changes to `settings.local.php.example` and save it as `settings.local.php`.

## Drush Make

There are several bundled make files:

* `my_profile.make` - This gets renamed to the installation profile's machine name and should contain modules than relate specifically to your project.
* `base.make` - common modules and libraries
* `images.make` - Media module and other image-related modules
* `panels.make` - Panels modules related dependencies
* `theme.make` - Dependencies for Arcturus/Aurora subthemes.

If using dev versions of modules, specific commit hashes are
preferable in the make files, rather than the more general dev branch.

## Installation profile

By building the site out as an installation profile, funcitonality can
easily be tracked in commit logs.

The [Profiler](http://drupal.org/project/profiler) library is used for
creating placeholder nodes, users and taxonomy terms, as well as
setting variables that don't make sense to commit to feature modules.

## Advanced Usage

### Customize developer modules

The `bin/install` script will enable a set of developer modules. This
can be customzed by setting the `TURNIP_DEVELOPER_MODULES` environment
variable. For instance, in `.bashrc` or similar:

```
export TURNIP_DEVELOPER_MODULES="devel views_ui styleguide"
```

### Pulling and Merging
If you want to pull the most recent turnip changes, you can run:
   ```bash
   git fetch turnip
   git merge --no-commit turnip/7.x
   ```
   This adds all the turnip changes to your local repo, but allows you to review them before committing them.
   Be warned this is likely to cause a lot of conflicts and you will have to figure out what changes from upstream you wish to override any local changes and vice versa.


### Using Vagrant

For highly customized server requirements, or just to have a stable
and consistent environment to develop on, Turnip ships with a default
Vagrant configuration that will launch a Drupal site in a box.

1. Make sure [Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) are installed.
1. Run `bin/install`
1. At this point, [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) should be serving Drupal.
1. Stop the server with `bin/stop`, and then restart with `bin/run`
1. Customize the server in `manifests/webserver.pp`. An Apache Solr example is included if that is required for search.
1. Values or settings in `Vagrantfile` can be overridden by adding a
   `Vagrantfile.local`, should individual environments require this. A
   common example is for forwarding port 80 to a different port than
   the one defined.

#### Drush with Vagrant
You can set up a Drush alias in your local environment to point to the currently active vagrant box. Adapt this entry to be inserted into your `~/.drush/aliases.drushrc.php` file (Drush 7.x/master only):
```
$aliases['localhost'] = array(
  'uri' => 'localhost',
  'root' => '/vagrant/drupal',
  'remote-user' => 'vagrant',
  'remote-host' => 'localhost',
  'ssh-options' => '-i /Users/my-username/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key -p2222',
);
```
Example usage: `drush @localhost cache-clear all`


### Adding contrib modules

If you need to install a module that's **not** part of Turnip, add the module to the my_profile.make file (e.g. `projects[bad_judgement][version] = 1.0-rc39`).
